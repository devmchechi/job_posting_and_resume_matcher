Title: Product Engineer Co-op (6-month)
Location: Boston (in-person; customer exposure expected)
Reports to: CEO
Stage: Early growth (team of ~10)

Why this role
Levo helps healthcare providers recruit and retain frontline talent — nurses, caregivers, clinicians, and others on the front lines of patient care. We're looking for a Product Engineer Co-op who thrives at the intersection of product and engineering.

This 6-month role is ideal for a Northeastern senior who wants to experience real ownership inside a fast-moving startup. You'll sit in on customer calls, use AI to accelerate how we ship code, and own features end-to-end — from mock-up to monitoring in production.

You'll work directly with the CEO and senior engineers, helping build tools used by some of the largest healthcare providers in the country.

What You'll Own

Product + Engineering Execution
* End-to-end ownership: mock-up, build, ship, and monitor features.
* Use AI tools daily (Copilot, Devin, etc.) to speed up development and ensure quality.
* Write tests and manage CI/CD for your own work.
* Join customer calls and implementations to integrate feedback directly.

Customer-Centered Development
* Translate customer asks into product requirements and user stories.
* Actively participate in customer implementations; understand workflows firsthand.
* Ship features that are reliable and usable in real healthcare environments.

Collaboration & Growth
* Work closely with Jason (CEO), Mikey, and Lily in Boston.
* Contribute ideas to product direction and development priorities.
* Propose and lead small workflow/process improvements to help the team ship faster.

15/30/45/90/120/180 Day Expectations

At 15 Days
* Get up to speed on Levo's stack (React, TypeScript, Go).
* Ship small but meaningful fixes/features (1–2 days speed-to-first-PR).
* Shadow customer calls and implementations.

At 30 Days
* Own and ship your first feature end-to-end (mock-up → build → ship → monitor).
* Balance speed of delivery with production reliability.

At 45–90 Days
* Contribute to customer implementations and integrations.
* Propose and execute improvements to engineering workflows or developer tooling.
* Gain confidence in guiding AI-generated code and writing appropriate guardrails.

At 120–180 Days
* Take ownership of a product area, reliably shipping features customers use.
* Integrate customer feedback directly into your work.
* Present one internal "retrospective" on what you built, what you learned, and what you'd improve next cycle.

Who You Are
* Senior-level Northeastern student (CS, Computer Engineering, or related field).
* A builder with a track record — personal projects, hackathons, or internships.
* Solid technical foundation across modern web stacks (React, HTML, TypeScript, Go, Python, AWS, etc.).
* Adaptable and eager to learn new technologies quickly.
* Strong product sense: can identify what's worth building, not just how.
* Excited to use AI tools as leverage, not threatened by them.
* Energized by talking to customers and shaping features from their pain points.
* Thrives with support nearby but doesn't need handholding.

Read This Carefully
* 🚫 Not a ticket-taker — ✅ you'll decide what to build.
* 🚫 Not heads-down-only — ✅ you'll be customer-facing.
* 🚫 Not for order-followers — ✅ you'll have support but must set your own direction.

How We Work
* Always part of the solution – We don't stop at identifying problems; we fix them.
* Invent and simplify – We search for ideas everywhere and simplify relentlessly.
* Progress over perfection – We bias toward bold action, learn quickly, and adapt.
* See something, say something – Our wins and misses are collective; transparency is a must.
