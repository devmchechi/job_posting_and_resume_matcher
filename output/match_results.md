- Add "CSS" to the Skills section (even if basic) and mention any styling work done in the VaultDB.ai or other web projects.
- If you have any exposure to Go, include it (e.g., personal learning, small scripts, or coursework). If not, consider a brief statement of intent to learn Go quickly.
- Highlight any use of AI coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot in your development workflow; a simple bullet like "Leveraged GitHub Copilot to accelerate feature development and maintain code quality" will satisfy that requirement.
- Mention any monitoring/observability experience—e.g., using logging frameworks, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, or even simple health‑check endpoints you built for your embedded or web projects.
- Emphasize end‑to‑end product ownership: add a bullet under the VaultDB.ai project describing how you gathered requirements, designed mock‑ups, implemented, deployed, and monitored the service.
- Include a brief line about Agile methodology participation (e.g., sprint planning, stand‑ups, retrospectives) to reinforce your fit with the team's process culture.
- If you have any exposure to healthcare data or regulations (HIPAA, HL7), add a short note; otherwise, consider a personal project or coursework that touches on data privacy to show awareness.
- Quantify impact wherever possible (e.g., "Reduced deployment time by 40%", "Improved testing throughput by X%", "Supported 200‑student class with 100% satisfaction rating").
- Add a “Soft Skills” bullet list or integrate keywords such as "strong communication", "product sense", "self‑direction", "bias toward action", and "presentation skills" to align with the job description.
